This is the follow-along code for the Udemy class called "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3".
The idea with this page is that I would refamiliarize myself with basic HTML & CSS and learn any cool new HTML5 and CSS3 things.
After 50% completion of the course, I have actually learned a few little tricks, but for the most part, not a whole lot of new stuff.
But that's ok. I still learned something.
